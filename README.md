# DalamudPluginRepo
Custom [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goaaats/FFXIVQuickLauncher) plugin repository.  Don't use plugins in this repo that exist in the built-in Dalamud plugin repo unless there's a good reason to do so.  As of this writing, there's only one plugin here, because I don't know when (**or if**, although I don't see how it's that controversial of a plugin) it will get accepted to the main repo.

## Installation

First open the Dalamud Settings menu in the game, accessible through typing `/xlsettings` in the chat or through the button at the bottom of the Plugin Installer.

Then follow the image:
1. Click the "Experimental" tab.
2. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PunishedPineapple/DalamudPluginRepo/main/pluginmaster.json` into the empty box at the bottom of the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section (the last box will always have a + next to it).
3. Click the + button.
4. Click the "Save and Close" button.

Now these plugins will appear inside of the Plugin Installer, accessible through typing `/xlplugins` in the chat.
