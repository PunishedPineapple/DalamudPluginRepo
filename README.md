# DalamudPluginRepo
Custom [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goaaats/FFXIVQuickLauncher) plugin repository.  Don't use plugins in this repo that exist in the built-in Dalamud plugin repo unless there's a good reason to do so.

This repository contains the following plugins (and why they're here):
* [CIDNamer](https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/CIDNamer): This is intended for use with offline tools, so it could never be in the main Dalamud repo as-is.
* ~~[Distance](https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/Distance): This is waiting indefinitely for inclusion in the main Dalamud repo, presumably until rules for "Combat Plugins" are finalized.~~ This has been merged into Dalamud plugin testing.
* [HP Difference Gauge](https://github.com/PunishedPineapple/HPDiff): Assuming this would get poopoo'd on the main repo since the intended use is mostly DSR/TEA.  Even if not, I don't want to wait forever for a "combat plugin" to be debated on the main repo when this is a relatively specific and simple plugin that's not intended to be super polished.

## Installation

First open the Dalamud Settings menu in the game, accessible through typing `/xlsettings` in the chat or through the button at the bottom of the Plugin Installer.

Then follow the image:
1. Click the "Experimental" tab.
2. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PunishedPineapple/DalamudPluginRepo/main/pluginmaster.json` into the empty box at the bottom of the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section (the last box will always have a + next to it).
3. Click the + button.
4. Click the "Save and Close" button.

Now these plugins will appear inside of the Plugin Installer, accessible through typing `/xlplugins` in the chat.
